            <p className="vin-hero-brief">
                The concept of Vine City is very similar to virtual nations that are essentially DAOs working on decentralized network. The main difference 
                between Vine City and the existing Virtual nations is that Vine City is modeled as an Economic Organisation that have heirarchy, poses real world assets
                and provides its citizen to adopt different roles in its society according to their capabilities.<br/><br/> Vine City provides its citizen to change/formulate its laws,
                select representatives through voting according to manifestos, raise proposels to buy real world assets like land, gold, minerals etc. The asset pool of Vine City 
                is like the entire wealth of the Nation which grows when citizen produce valueble goods/services very much like a real nation's economy grows. All the citizen's wealth they
                poses is proportional to their investments  in the asset pool. <br/><br/>Vine City have the potential to grow as a nation, buy land for it, launch space missions using its asset pool,
                fund scientific innovations etc. The aim of Vine City is to create a nation truly without borders that solely promotes meritocracy and moves forward for the sake of humankind's progress.
